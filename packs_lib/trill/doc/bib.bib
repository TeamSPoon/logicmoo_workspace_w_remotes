  abstract = {
The increasing popularity of the Semantic Web drove to a wide-
spread adoption of Description Logics (DLs) for modeling real world domains.
To help the diffusion of DLs, a large number of reasoning algorithms have been
developed. Usually these algorithms are implemented in procedural languages
such as Java or C++. Most of the reasoners exploit the tableau algorithm
which features non-determinism, that is not easily handled by those languages.
Prolog directly manages non-determinism, thus is a good candidate for dealing
with the tableau's non-deterministic expansion rules.
We present TRILL, for "Tableau Reasoner for descrIption Logics in pro-
Log", that implements a tableau algorithm and is able to return explanations
for queries and their corresponding probability, and TRILLP , for "TRILL
powered by Pinpointing formulas", which is able to compute a Boolean for-
mula representing the set of explanations for a query. Reasoning on real world
domains also requires the capability of managing probabilistic and uncertain
information. We show how TRILL and TRILLP can be used to compute the
probability of queries to knowledge bases following DISPONTE semantics.
Experiments comparing these with other systems show the feasibility of the
approach.},

  Representing uncertain information is crucial for modeling real world domains. In this paper we present a technique for the integration of probabilistic information in Description Logics (DLs) that is based on the distribution semantics for probabilistic logic programs. In the resulting approach, that we called DISPONTE, the axioms of a probabilistic knowledge base (KB) can be annotated with a real number between 0 and 1. A probabilistic knowledge base then defines a probability distribution over regular KBs called worlds and the probability of a given query can be obtained from the joint distribution of the worlds and the query by marginalization. We present the algorithm BUNDLE for computing the probability of queries from DISPONTE KBs. The algorithm exploits an underlying  DL reasoner, such as Pellet, that is able to return explanations for  queries. The explanations are encoded in a Binary Decision Diagram from which the probability of the query is computed. The experimentation of BUNDLE shows that it
can handle probabilistic KBs of realistic size.
